## My process

I decide to use React for this project because it consisted of two card type components that needed to switch between each other by clicking buttons or arrow keys. React allows us to make reusable components and also dinamycaly update content of webpage. Before I usually was using create-react-app to start my React project but the authors of this library stop support so I decided to try Vite, which actively supported by community and has a smaller bundle size.

### Built with

- Vite
- React JS

### What I learned

During development of this page I learned how to use Vite to start a React project. Vite also allows to host your site locally so I was able to check the look of web page on my mobile device.
Another new thing that I learn were "<q>" html element and its corresponding CSS property. I didn't know that you can style quotes by using CSS and special codes for quotes appearence.
I also liked that this challenge has requeremnt of using JavaScript to make carousel.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
